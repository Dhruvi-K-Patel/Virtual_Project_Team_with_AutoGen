## System Workflow  
1. **Customer Request**: The **Customer Proxy Agent** initiates a new software project request.  
2. **Project Planning**: The **Project Manager** analyzes the request and creates a project plan.  
3. **Requirement Analysis**: The **Requirement Engineer** gathers project requirements.  
4. **System Design**: The **System Engineer** creates design documents.  
5. **Software Development**: The **Software Engineer** writes the source code.  
6. **Software Testing**: The **Test Engineer** validates the code against the requirements.  
7. **Documentation**: The **Documentation Engineer** prepares manuals and training materials.

## Agents and Their Roles  

| **Agent Name**          | **Role in Project** |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| **Customer Proxy**      | Acts as a client representative, sending project requests. |
| **Project Manager**     | Plans the project and assigns tasks to agents. |
| **Requirement Engineer** | Gathers project requirements and creates a requirement document. |
| **System Engineer**     | Converts requirements into system design specifications. |
| **Software Engineer**   | Develops the software based on the design document. |
| **Test Engineer**       | Creates and executes test cases to verify software functionality. |
| **Documentation Engineer** | Writes user manuals and training guides. |

Each agent follows **structured steps** to ensure efficient project execution.

## Usage
1. **Start the Virtual Team**
Run the notebook to initialize AI agents.
2. **Assign a Project Request**
The Customer Proxy agent provides a new project request.
3. **AI-Driven Project Execution**
The AI agents will handle planning, requirements, development, testing, and documentation automatically.
4. **Monitor Progress**
The workflow follows a round-robin conversation among agents to ensure structured execution.

## Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ **Integrate a Web Interface** â€“ Build a GUI for better project visualization.
ðŸ”¹ **Enhance AI Decision Making** â€“ Implement reinforcement learning to improve project management.
ðŸ”¹ **Expand Role Diversity** â€“ Introduce more specialized agents like DevOps Engineer & Security Analyst.
ðŸ”¹ **Cloud Deployment** â€“ Deploy the system to cloud environments for real-time collaboration.

## Conclusion
AutoTeamX brings AI-driven automation to software development teams, optimizing project management with virtual AI agents. By simulating real-world development workflows, it ensures efficient execution, intelligent decision-making, and structured collaboration.
